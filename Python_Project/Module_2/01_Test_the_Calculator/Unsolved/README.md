# Activity: Test the Calculator

In this activity, you'll create a calculator test for the loan-to-value ratio function.

## Background

For this activity, use the following acceptance criteria:

> Given a home value of $250,000, when I ask for a $210,000 mortgage, I should see a loan-to-value ratio of 84%, or 0.84.


## Instructions

Use the files in the Unsolved folder to complete the following steps.

1. Run the `test_qualifier` file using the `pytest` command to see what kind of output you get.

2. Write the test code based on the acceptance criteria to test `calculate_loan_to_value_ratio`.

3. Run the tests again with `pytest`. You should now see the two tests pass.

    > **Hint** If your tests don't pass, revisit your code in Step 2!
