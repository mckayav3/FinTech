# Module 2 Challenge - Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command-line application that allows a user to see what loans they qualify for. The application works by taking in the user's criteria for the following: credit score, income, debt, and loan information. The application then compares this criteria against 'daily_rate_sheet' to see what loans the user qualifies for based on the their input. The application then allows the user the option to save their qualified loan data to a csv file so they can acces it at a later date if neccessary.
